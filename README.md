# dotfiles
Custom Linux configuration files, including default oh-my-zsh and
vundle configuration

## Instalation

Just use `git` and the installation script:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/abravalheri/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

This script will symlink the dotfiles, clone the required repositories
(vundle, oh-my-zsh), ask you about your name and email and many other things

Please make sure to have `git`, `ruby`, `tmux`, `vim` and `astyle` installed before running this.
